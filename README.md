## 📖 Overview
This notebook — **`my_first_refactored_program.ipynb`** — contains all **14 beginner-friendly Python programs**, rewritten and refactored for clarity, modularity, and reusability.  
Each program demonstrates a specific concept using **functions, loops, conditionals, and user input handling**.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- ✅ Clean & modular function-based design  
- 🧩 Includes **error handling** and **type hints**  
- 📘 Interactive **menu system** for program selection  
- 🌈 Enhanced **readability** with decorative lines and colors  
- 🔄 Combines multiple logical tasks into a single Jupyter file
